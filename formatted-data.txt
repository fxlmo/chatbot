The wording on slide 13 of the Thermal lecture explaining Kirchoffs law is unclear. It says "Kirchoffs law says that for each particular frequency then e=alpha. So for IR absorbtance we use e instead of the
usual solar radiation alpha"
What actually is Kirchoffs law? Does it simply mean that for IR frequencies e=alpha?
Also on slide 28, why is the "waste heat rejected by the radiator" term on the side of the heat gain? Is it not heat being lost? Therefore should be negative?
Thanks

Please note that the question is: Calculate the size of a flat solar array necessary to power a to 1000W stabilised nadir pointing Polar Orbiter. Make assumptions for the design of the solar array and state these clearly. Distance of Mercury from Sun is given at the beginning of the paper).
It says clearly that you should make assumptions (any reasonable ones will do) for solar panel efficiency and degradation factor. If you have done some calculations already you will be familiar with these values or you can just assume something sensible. You can work out the solar constant at mercury from the distance of Mercury from the sun given at the beginning of the paper.

Values such as the solar constant at mercury, the efficiency of gallium arsenide and the radiation degradation factor are used in the solutions but are not provided in the the question or in the list of constants, are we expected to remember them or has this changed from last year?
Thanks

Okay, I see.  I think I will use the K3 equation when it is above pi. It is just easier for me to understand and use.  Thanks for your explanation.

I had the same problem initially. For the example sheet, you need to take the positive value of E instead of the negative one (there are 2 solutions to E).As for the question in the 2017 paper, if you look at how the eccentric anomaly is calculated, its easy to see that when the true anomaly goes up to pi, the eccentric anomaly will be similar to pi. Hope that helps.

I was using radians.  The same happened in 2017 past paper, Q2(c). When the true anomaly goes up to pi, the left hand side of the equation becomes tan(pi/2), which gives infinity.  From what I'm guessing, when the true anomaly goes at or above pi, we need to use the Newton form of K3 to work out time taken using geometry

Are you using radians or degrees? The formulae only work with radians.

Does the Kepler Equation (the set of three) not work up until the true anomaly is above pi or 180?  I tried to calculate the time taken from 0 to 210 on Example sheet 2 Q2, and ending up having a negative E hence negative time taken?

I asked the same question a few days ago, and Lucy said this will not be examined.  She also said that some of the questions on Example sheets are meant to stretch us out of our knowledge, so not necessary all question types on Example sheets are examinable.

On the Rockets Example Sheet, the final question involves molecular masses and atomic weights to calculate the specific Impulse.  Is this something we need to know how to do for the exam, as the learning objective just says to be able to use Specific Impulse in calculations, but I cannot find reference to calculations involving these anyvvhere else. Thank you!

Ahh I see. Putting Tl and T2 into the Newton form of K3 and then manipulate. Thank you very much.

Just write them out for each case: Tl and T2 and then divide one by another and cancel etc.

Just wondering how do we get the relation: (M+m1)/(M+m2)=(T2/T1)^2*(a1/a2)^3? Thank you.

it sounds like 1368 has been used instead of 1370, certainly no katmos has been used, in fact if it is not mentioned then katmos=1. Equally if it is not mentioned that the spacecraft is spinning then Lp is assumed to be 1. It is very worthwhile to write these assumptions down at the beginning of your answer.

2) For Space Radiator's equation, is it basically the same equation as the Thermal Balance equation, with an additional heat rejected term, Qw? Which way around do the view factors should be on this equation? rp-sc or ,sc-p?

I hope I have made my questions clear and you could answer them on here for me. Thank you.

Thanks for your reply. In that case does the ECI reference system use the first point of Aries as the reference direction rather than the Vernal Equinox, as is stated on slide 14 of Orbits 27

The notes define the first point of Aries as "the point where the equatorial meets plane meets the ecliptic". Will this be correct if we are asked to definite it in the exam? Or should we mention something along the lines of "it is the position of the Sun relative to Earth at the Vernal Equinox"? But neither of those definitions mention that is a vector, as is stated on slide 8 of Orbits 27

Essentially I understand the concept, but would like to know the specific wording that will gain the marks in the exam if this question is asked.

A basic search in Google for "gravity gradient spacecraft stabilization" yields the ever present wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity-gradient_stabilization), which should always be taken with a pinch of salt, and several more technical descriptions (for example, https://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/views/pdfs/V03_N5_1964/V3_N5_ 1964_Fischell.pdf).

The idea is always that if something (i.e. gravity force) is pulling you along one axis then when you deviate from this axis lateral components of that force are generated which bring you back to the initial position (unless you intentionally apply a force opposing this restoring motion).

Also note that "tidal" does not mean sea movement in this case. best

In the target operations, the three velocity components can be created by using the "Vary" option three times. For the first burn of the Hohmann transfer, the iterating process then outputs a burn in three deltaV components where the V and B components are non-zero.

I thought that burning in the B component was inefficient (I'm burning at Apoapsis) - So is it acceptable to only use one "Vary" in the V component at this stage? This would then give two zero values for N and B components of deltaV which looks a bit silly in the table provided in the coursework template which has three columns.

01. In the missions tab, do we need to have an 'achieve' command for transfer orbit?

02. In the end, adding an 'Achieve' command to get an ecc=O leads to no convergence. whereas, on removing that achieve command significant convergence is obtained. What would be more preferred between the 2 cases?

Turntin provides a% similarity for plagiarism purposes when you submit your work. We will look at each piece of work and if it is clear that the similarity is due to the questions being repeated between all the papers, then there is no problem. If the text has clearly been copied from the internet or someone else's work then the usual University plagiarism procedure is invoked.

The question doesn't seem to contain the value for eccentricity. Are we supposed to assume the orbit to be circular?

Sorry to be confusing, but it would be helpful for us if you could paste the WHOLE GMAT script in to the coursework, not just the mission section. I realise this is long, but otherwise we may not know what parameters you have called.

For our GMAT script submission, would you like the whole script copy and pasted (which is around 200 lines) or just the mission sequence section? Thanks

Well done for spotting this! I am checking in to how I did this. We have to be careful not to assume a result that we are deducing...

And also thus can we conclude that -(bA2/aA2)= (2Eh 112)/(m µ A2) ? Thank you:)

Eccentricity? Eccentricity?

Posted Date: Status:

From the Annex, it is said that the eccentricity is equal to [1+(2EhA2 )/(m µ A2)] 11(1/2), and in mathematic the eccentricity is [1-(b112/a112)]11(1/2). I was wondering how one would get to the conlcusion that the eccentricity would be [1+(2eh112)/(µ 112) ]11(1 /2).

Was it by comparison, from the derivation that r=(hA2/ µ)/{1+[1+(2eh112)/(µ 112)]11(1/2)cos8} and the mathmatical equation for a conic section r=p/(1+ecos 8), thus p= (hA2/µ) and that e=

[1+(2eh112)/(µ 112}JA(1/2) 7

Dear Tanuj, You are not restricted to the Earth, but the aim of this coursework is to apply the principles of orbital mechanics that you have already learn ed. If you wish to apply them to a non-Earth mission

In the coursework brief it says we can " elect any mir;r;ionr; under development or proposed for development"; does this mean we cannot choose missions that have already been completed or that are currently live? Thanks!

Thank you for this excellent question and my apologies for the delay, I have only just seen that I was not subscribed to the discussion threads (aargh)! The reason why astronauts appear to float in space, is that they are in 'freefall' i.e. they are freely falling around the Earth in their spacecraft. Some links to explain this better:

In the last lecture we have seen that even if the variation of g with altitude is significant for space, it is still quite above what we could call "microgravity". If the g reduction is not that meaningful, why do we float in space? Which is the correct explanation for that? Thank you.
